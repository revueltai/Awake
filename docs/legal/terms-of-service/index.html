        <h2>Awakeme Terms of Service &amp; Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy governs the use of the software application Awakeme ("Application") for mobile devices.

        <p>The Application obtains information about the Geolocation of the user and this used internally to locate the current position of the person in the map.</p>

        <h4>Automatically Collected Information</h4>
        <p>The Application may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device of the user, the user's mobile devices unique device ID (UID), the IP address of the user's mobile device, the user's mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers of the user, and information about the way the Application is used.</p>

        <h4>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</h4>
        <p>Yes. The Application may use GPS technology (or other similar technology) to determine the user's current location. The user's current location will not be shared with other users or partners. If the user does not want the Application to use Geolocation for the purposes set forth above, him/her should turn off the location services for the mobile application located in the account settings or in the user's mobile phone settings and/or within the mobile application. However, this will affect the functioning of the Application.</p>

        <h4>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h4>
        <p>No. The Application does not share the information with third parties.</p>
        <p>However, we may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect the users rights, protect the user's safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Application makes use of other plugins (Google Maps, Google Places). Each plugin is the responsibility of its provider. We have no control over the amount of information that the respective provider collects with the help of its own plugin, or how it then uses that information.</p>
        <p>If the user is not yet a customer of the provider or has not (yet) consented there to having its data collected and used, we recommend not clicking on these plugins.</p>
        <p>If, on the other hand, the user is already a customer of the plugin provider, it should refer directly to the relevant provider for information on the kind and amount of personal data it collects and uses, and for what purpose.</p>

        <h4>User opt-out rights</h4>
        <p>The user can stop all collection of information by the Application by uninstalling the Application. The user may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of the mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>

We limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Application. Please be aware that, although we endeavor provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.</p>
